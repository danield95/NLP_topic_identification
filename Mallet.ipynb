       "0  Hello I wonder if anyone has any advice. I have had a very stressful few months in my life. Last week I had breathing problems a shortness of breath with no pain. I went to urgent care who listened to my lungs and heart and said it was an anxiety attack. I went to my GP next day who said it was an anxiety attack to.\\nSince then I have managed to ease the attacks but I've been experiencing some tingling of and on in left arm. Again a dull pain in left of chest just above the left breast. Again of and on . Does this sound like a heart attack is building ? Or could it. E the aftermath of anxiety . \\nI am worried to go back to gp incase I am getting on there nerves.\\nAlso would listening in with stethoscope show if there was a problem with the heart ? \\nThanks in advance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1  Hi, I'm new here.  Does anyone out there have Alcapa Syndrome, or had it corrected by surgery?  I was diagnosed with this congenital defect in 2015 and have had 2 lots of open heart surgery to improve my prognosis.  Alcapa Syndrome is SUCH a rare condition, it feels quite lonely being unable to share my experiences with another person who really understands the challenges.

       "5  Hi, I'm X.  I'm X years old and was diagnosed with advanced heart failure just over 5.5 years ago while 31 weeks pregnant.  My daughter was delivered the very next day (bit of a shock!) and we both started our journeys towards health/recovery.  My daughter is doing great - loads of fun, loads of hard work, starting school soon, with no long-term ill effects from her early arrival as far as anyone can tell.  Things for me are still not great.  My heart is not at all what it should be, but has been stable for a few years now, and stable (as my consultant always likes to remind me) is good.  I take lots of medication and have a CRT-D device fitted.  I've spent the last few years really working on my mental health (with fantastic support from a BHF-funded psychologist as well as my GP and other health professions) and, now that I've made so much progress on that side of things, am hoping to make some progress with my physical health through lifestyle changes - diet, exercise etc.\\n\\nI'd love to hear from...\\n* anyone who's doing their best to exercise (and/or diet) with a heart condition, maybe even someone looking for an online fitness buddy?\\n* any \"women of child-bearing age\" (ugh!) with or without children\\n* anyone who's managing to see their heart condition as a positive experience in any way (or living positively despite viewing their situation as negative)\\n* anyone at all really!\\nThanks :)\\n  \n",
       "6  I've suffered  with very frequent heart palpitations for the last 2 years, which isn't too serious compared to most heart conditions, but can be very distressing . I've had every cardiac test going and my cardiologist can't find anything wrong. So I'm now on Carvedilol (beta blocker)  and Ramipril as I now have high blood pressure. I'm due another cardiac MRI in a few weeks to see if there have been any changes over the last year. There is a possibility of dilated cardiomyopathy. I would love to connect with others who have similar problems....it kind of drives you crazy sometimes, when these irregular heartbeats won't stop, and sometimes keeps me awake at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "8  2.38. Early hours of Tuesday 30 May. I’m X, fit, active, no health problems. I’ve spent the previous day gardening, nothing heavy, and have gone to bed and to sleep as usual. I’m  alone: my husband died 19 months ago but I’m coping well. Family and friends are all around.\\nThe pain that wakes me is between my shoulder blades, intense. I know there’s something seriously wrong but I’ve no idea I’m having a heart attack. Impossible, the pains would be in my chest.\\nOne hour: I’m rolling down the Ecclesbourne Valley in an ambulance on my way to the X X .\\nThe cardiac liaison nurse who, a week later, is helping me get ready for home, says few people know the full facts of heart attack pain. I didn’t know the pains might be across the back orin the throat  and that women especially might experience them in those places rather than in the chest. Friends who’ve called in since I came home didn’t know either. Look up Signs of a Heart Attack on the internet and the emphasis is always first on chest pains.\\nI’d like to help in any way possible to give wider publicity to the signs of heart attack in women. I’m used to contacting local media, including social media. I should like your advice as to what I can usefully do to turn my experience into something positive.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                 \n",

He's answer is that if X and X sell it it must be OK!!! \\nSo I then try to explain that because I'm taking statins I probably need a magnesium test to see if I'm deficent? And if so can I take a magnesium supplement as I'm not sure if I'm getting enough from my diet.\\nso he's answer oh I can send you for a blood test..All good but I've read on here that a normal magnesium test isn't the real picture.\\nSomeone on this forum mentioned it's a specific blood test for magnesium. \\nCAN ANYONE HELP WITH THIS PLEASE?? \\nSo so far it was the usual rushed appointment but I suppose at leat I got ONE THING out of it...a letter to other consultant's in X of my Dr's choice may I add...Seriously you couldn't make it up!!  \\nQuestions: Can anyone give me some idea of good Cq10 supplements X Magnesium once I've had a test for that. \\nAlso can I ask the hospital for a detailed letter regarding my stent procedure in May last year?\\nWill they release such a letter to me the patient?\\nI basically want to know what happened during my procedure because my cardiologist openly said it was very difficult and he was concerned about me?\\nThat's how it's always been left..so in truth I want some answers Especially as my chest pain has got more frequent post stent than before I was even taken into hospital back last April.\\nThank you to everybody that can help me with my questions. ?\\nPs   I also asked him about my latest blood tests...some of which I've posted on here.\\nHe's answer oh all normal with a gruff voice..so all good then? Yeah right considering my LDL is slightly above the 2.0 it should be at...so no doctorits not normal to a heart patient. \\nI asked him about my HbA1c level and LDL particle number and he's response was a blank stare!

Only low levels say less than 20 a day but feel every single one and they cause anxiety every time.\\nHave been muddling on ok for a while though through X I started to get more episodes when training in the gym.  Last year I had a couple of occasions where they started up during cardio exercise and didn't stop.\\nHave had probably in excess of 30 ecgs over the years, maybe more. Nothing of note has come up on those.\\n4 Holter monitors which showed wenkebach during sleep and 3 echoes - last one in X - all normal.\\nWell this year?\\nI managed to catch the flu first week of January so I stopped training in the gym. \\nTwo weeks ago tomorrow I decided that i felt well enough to restart and that's where everything has gone wrong.\\n30 mins into cardio training, I started getting pvcs. I started getting panicky so left after a further 10 mins and went straight to a &amp; e. Ecg was all over the place and showed long qt plus some other stuff.\\nThe doctor said I might have long qt and my anxiety shot through the roof and has stayed at the same level since. \\nCutting a long story short, ever since then, I have developed pvcs every time I stand up, walk around, do any kind of activity at all.\\nOver the next week I had 3 trips to a &amp; e with pvcs and all showed sinus tachycardia and nothing else.\\nHad a stress test done privately on Wednesday which showed pvcs in the first few minutes and a couple in the cool down but none at higher heart rates.\\nSaw my electrophysisist / cardiologist who said my stress test was perfectly fine, not bothered about the pvcs and said I had excellent exercise capability but he was going to put me on a low dose betablocker in the short term because my anxiety over the pvcs had got to a point where I was actually struggling to stand up because I was so scared.\\nHe couldn't really answer why they had started so suddenly out of the blue when id never really had a major issue with them before and he said I probably always had them with training but I don't think I did apart from the odd \"pvc storm\" once or twice a year.\\nI'm now on a betablocker and I'm not getting any pvcs anymore when standing/ moving around but I am still getting them during training.\\nI am very scared and anxious when training which I don't think helps.\\nI am just struggling to understand why these have just started so badly whilst training when I have trained for 20 years before without problem. \\nI have to say at this point that training is my life. I'm a X and train 6 days a week and it keeps me sane so this is turning into a living nightmare for me because I'm getting terrified that something dangerous is happening whilst I'm getting the pvcs and training.\\nI thought they might be due to my massive amounts of adrenaline coursing round my system because I've always had pvcs during emotional stress and sex but the cardiologist said they probably weren't caused by excess adrenaline, not to worry and carry on training.\\nI'm just struggling with not having a reason to why this has suddenly happen and in the space of 4 weeks, going from a normal human being to being utterly housebound. I'm scared of doing anything to trigger the pvcs off so I'm not training, not working, not doing anything except laying in bed and I don't know what to do or how to deal with it.\\nI'm already on anti depressants and seeing a counsellor.\\nI just want to understand what is making my heart do what it is so if anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer any words of wisdom or advice, I'd be very grateful as I am missing my training, it's really getting me down and I really want my normal life back.\\nThanks, X xx\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>I wrote here a few weeks ago about some chest pain I have been suffering with for a while now but I have no diagnosis diagnosis even after 2 exercise ECGs and an echo.  ive since had continuing chest pain and another ECG at my GP but they still cant find anything and have said the ECGs are fine.  I feel like im getting more breathless at time and feel like my chest pain is getting worse.  when this started the chest pain was kind of off to the side, left hand side, I find im getting more pain which is right in the middle and a little bit lower down.  Yesterday I felt sick due to the pain in chest, kind of had a bit of pain on my left shoulder and I was getting funny feelings up my neck, its like a prickly feeling, someone sticking a needle in now and again but I get these in my chest as well.  I also had a funny feeling around the top of my chest at the collar bone area on the left hand side. and a funny feeling under my chin, kind of like a flushing sensation. Ive also found im coughing more but I don't have a cold or chest infection.\\n\\nMy GP is going to refer me to cardio so I can speak to someone this time but in the meantime im concerned about my chest pain and feelings in my neck/shoulder.  Yesterday I was out with some friends and the pain was quite bad and I felt a little sick too but then I felt a bit panicky inside (i dont have anxiety) about it but I noticed if I stood up straight and kind of pushed my chest out I had a tight feeling on the left hand side of my chest- it was like a line drawn across my chest - hard to describe.  when I came home I had 150mg of aspirin and that seemed to help the pain.  I don't want to go to A&amp;E because I don't want to waste their time in case I don't have heart/artery issues but I feel ive got to do something due to the on-going pain.\\n\\nfeel a bit lost to be honest and not sure what to do for the best as I expect my referral to cardio will take weeks if not months...\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Day 15 the day from hell !!!!!\\nI wasn’t going to post the following account of day 15 as I thought it’s possibly a step too far but when I started doing these posts  I said it would be truthful warts and all so I’ve decided to tell it like it was and if I offend anyone in the process I apologise in advance. I’ve always been an honest person and to me it’s just another part of my X on the road to full recovery . \\nI told you I’d been a little constipated well things came to a head yesterday it started about about 2pm when I got the urge to go but couldn’t it was there but I couldn’t pass it . I told the nurse who gave me senokot I wanted to do a walk but after 50 metres I got the urge and had to come back sat in the loo for about 45 minutes absolutely nothing would pass . I went up to my room at 4pm to be near the loo just in case as the pain was starting to become a problem . She said it’s been caused by my lifesaver painkillers “Oxycodon” apparently anything with “co” in the title contains codene and this is the major cause of severe constipation. I missed evening supper at 6.30pm as I was scared to leave the room and wasn’t hungry anyway . I had been sat on the loo for another hour but something was stuck there was no way I was going to be able to pass this stool it just felt an impossible task I was told not to push too hard because of my new heart valve just do lots of little pushes. It was now 8.30pm and I’m in real pain I needed a wee but it felt like something was pushing on my prostate and although the urge to have a wee was there I now couldn’t pass water so I’m worried . The nurse said your not gonna like this but I need you to lie on your left hand side on the bed which I did and she proceeded to give me an embarrassing sepository and an enema I had to lay there for at least 10 minutes or longer if I could ignoring the urge to go. After 15 minutes there was still no urge 20 minutes still nothing I lay there for 30 minutes then went to the X ....... what a disaster loads of diarrhoea but “he who would not surface “ was still stuck and refusing to budge I was now very worried and had visions of having to go to the local hospital to be sorted as I was in a lot of pain . The nurse was amazing she kept reassuring me that between us we would sort it . It’s now 11.00pm and I’m given another dose of senokot I told her it’s not going to work I’m just going to do lots more diarrhoea but it won’t sort out the real problem the blockage . I’m now sat there swearing at my my poo .......... come on you little bastard .......why won’t you bleep bleep come. ..... frustration and pain send you over the edge I hope no one heard me because if they had they would  have thought I was a complete fruitcake  !!! \\nThe nurse came back at 11.45pm and suggested she put some gloves on and massaged my rectum from behind whilst I sat on the X ......... I can honestly say I’ve never felt so vulnerable, embarressed  and completely exposed as I did when she was doing that. It was painful and she kept apologising but I told her to carry on as this needed sorting I’d got to the stage where I didn’t care any longer this had to come out . 30 minutes of massage of the rectum and she wanted me to start pushing oh my god I was pushing she was massaging and it eventually happened I can’t describe how it felt it was a mixture of joy, an element of embarrassment and complete relief and within minutes of it happening the pressure was off my prostate and I was able to wee which was a godsend. It’s now around 12.45 to 1am and it’s all about getting cleaned up and trying to get some sleep I thought I’d endured enough embarrassment for one day then she came back in the room and said because of all the laxatives we’ve given you plus the enema and the sepository I’m gonna need you to wear this just for tonight in case you have an accident while your asleeep ........... “an adult pull-up “ I said what do you expect me to do with that she said wear it under your boxers or your pyjamas just for tonight after everything she’d done for me it was the least I could do so I got changed and went to bed \\nI Woke up this morning and after a coffee managed to go  to the loo without pain that will be last nights senakot still working through \\nThe events between 2pm and 1 am yesterday were so bizarre you mind is saying ...... did that really happen ......... well unfortunately it did. I now have the dilemma of knowing what the root cause is “ Oxycoden” and trying to cut back on using my pain killers it’s a viscous circle and one that’s gonna take some real managing as I never want to find myself in a similar situation to yesterday \\nI’m shattered and need to catch up on some sleep and as previously stated I hope I haven’t offended anyone by just being honest \\n\\nX ❤️\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>After seventeen days in hospital, fifteen post op I finally made it home on Saturday.\\nWell, that was an experience, I am thinking of designing a new board game titled Grandma’s Heart Surgery.\\nI was in theatre for nearly nine hours as my surgeon tried three times to repair my mitral valve, each time restarting my heart to test the repair.  It was to no avail and so a mechanical valve was inserted as agreed pre-op. Seemingly my valve had some rheumatic damage (confirming that I had rheumatic fever as a child), also one of the mitral flaps had a very wavy edge instead of being a smooth curve; a congenital defect. The four other procedures were carried out.\\nForty-eight hours in X were not very pleasant, nausea, sickness, extremely sensitive sense of taste and smell and wierd dreams.  Fortunately it went by quite quickly and I was very sluggish.  I found the strong pain killing drugs were the worse for making me ill so forty-eight hours post op decided to only take paracetamol.  I did have some pain particularly as the paracetamol wore off but managed to control it with some breathing techniques etc.  I will write about this in ‘my tips’ further on. I think you always need to feel some pain so that you can tell if you are doing something that is damaging the healing.\\nThree days in X began with my body reacting differently than most to the anaesthetic and morphine, let’s just say I didn’t need laxatives!  At the same time I had put on twelve kilos with fluid retention. I could hardly breath or move and so the poor nursing angels had to do everything for me.  Once the intravenous diuretic got working  the fluid started to come off and I became mobile. Lost two or three kilos a day, I have never lost weight so quickly. I wouldn’t recommend that particular diet regime though. My pacing wires were left in for as long as possible to allow my heart to remain in sinus rhythm and were removed day five post op and a day after the chest drains. I didn’t find having any of them out particularly unpleasant, the little sensation I did feel was short lived and being free of them was bliss.\\nStill suffering with the trots, I was moved to a room on the X.  Another step in the right direction.  Shortly after returning to the X my heart went into Afib, back to theatre for a cardioversion, unfortunately it didn’t work so going to be reviewed in three months.  Chest X-ray showing fluid around lungs so kept on strong diuretics.  Next came an increase in my white blood cell count, normal is ten mine had risen to fifteeen, every possible bodily fluid was tested for infection, all negative. They didn’t take any chances so had me back on intravenous antibiotics. Having had mitral valve surgery there is a slight risk of Endocarditis, an infection that attacks the wall of the heart. Slowly my white blood cell count came down and was switched to oral antibiotics, first box✔️. Second chest X-ray showed that the fluid around my lungs had reduced but still not good enough to go home.  Came off intravenous anticoagulant and started Warfarin, my INR reading needed to be stable at between three and four before I could go home. Chest X-ray on Friday showed quite an improvement, still a small amount of fluid but happy for me to go home on strong diuretics, another box✔️.  Blood test showed good INR reading, last box✔️. Yippee, I could go home.\\nThis is not a scare story but one that reveals how resilient the human body and spirit are.  It is a tribute to the skill and dedication of the surgeon and his team; and the compassionate care of the nursing angels.\\nEach one of us  is different, everybody reacts differently, we all have complex heart issues unique to us but we all get through it with the skills of the professionals and by supporting one another.\\nMy tips are: \\nPractice these thoughts -  ‘this too will pass’; ‘just for today’; or even ‘just for this hour’; ‘today is the tomorrow I worried about yesterday’.\\nNot sure the menfolk will like this, take in copious amounts of 100% pure lavender oil and splash it on your huggy. It will aid breathing and help you to relax. I also used breathing exercises and meditated whilst listening to soft, relaxing music.\\nWeeks before surgery massage the incision site with bio oil twice daily to prepare your skin. My scar is looking pretty good already, half the stitches have dissolved.A big thank you to all my heart chums for keeping me in your thoughts, it was good to know you were rooting for me.\\nNow then, let’s get cracking designing my new board game, you never know it could be a best seller next X, especially if the winner gets a copy of my heart surgery video - yes my surgeon is preparing one for me as promised.\\nThe photo was taken as I left hospital, not bad?\\nLots of X,\\nX xxx❤️?❣️\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Arrived at hospital for my repeat scan on my left leg at 8.30am for my 9am appointment saw a different radiologist quite a chatty young man who’d been doing the job for X years and told me he scans everything from pregnant women to testicles looking for everything from baby abnormalities to blood clots to cancer. He told me the clot hadn’t moved any further up my thigh which was really good news . He showed me the blood clots on the screen which I found fascinating. It appears the antibiotics and daily injections are keeping them stable for now. My next appointment was at 10am at the phlebotomy department I was early and arrived at 9.30am and they said they might be able to get me in early. Everyone who was arriving was having blood tests done so I assumed that’s why I was here but the head nurse practitioner called me in and said I’m not taking bloods today I want to go through the negatives of you taking Tinzaparin on a daily basis for 6 weeks. She said your susceptible to excessive bleeding if you get a cut and it doesn’t clot in 30 minutes go to A&amp;E if you notice any bruising and don’t remember banging yourself go to A&amp;E if you get any headaches that appear to be coming up from your neck go to A&amp;E if you bang your head go straight to A&amp;E and they’ll check you for bleeding on the brain . .......... I said “ I’m so glad I’m come to see you today your a little ray of sunshine and full of positivity “ fortunately she got the irony. It’s good they take the time to warn you so it was appreciated. Next stop up to the X for all my info including my scan to be reviewed. I was sat in waiting room for about 10 minutes then taken onto a ward had to take my trousers off so they could examine my legs they said they were happy as the redness that was apparent a week ago had disappeared and the swelling had gone down . The asked me loads of questions about my heart and the op and then told me tha5 they were happy with the treatment plan and 5hey would do another Doppler scan after 5 weeks when the injections had finished. I would also receive an appointment to see the heamotologist. So I keep going and hopefully it’s all sorted in another 5 weeks. \\nAs you all know by now nothing is ever straight forward with me and I’ve had a bad cough for about three weeks and the constant coughing has resulted in me pulling the muscles in between my ribs on my left hand side this is really painful and affects movement and sleeping on Thursday I was on a local bus which was full of people and I started to have a coughing fit for some reason everything went quiet and it hurt that much I shouted out “ fucking bastard “  ( sorry) and everyone looked at me like I’d got “terets” I couldn’t wait to get off the bus . The doctor has given me a prescription for some antibiotics but I can’t use the prescription for another week because I’m already on antibiotics for my leg and he wants me to see if it will clear up on it’s own but I don’t see it shifting. \\nOn the good news side the doctor has just told me he’s happy for me to start driving whoooooooo !!!!! I can’t believe it I thought I’d have to wait 6 weeks but the DVLA say 4 weeks it’s given me back my freedom. X drove to the post office to take a letter that needed to go by recorded delivery I was sat in the car with a stupid grin on my face like I’d just won the lottery. Happy days. \\nThis X has made me realise how much easier it must be if your in a relationship and living with someone who is there 24/7 to support and do the things you can’t. Unfortunately I’ve just finalised my divorce as you know and not currently in a relationship and you do end up doing things you’ve been told not too which can affect your recovery. It’s not just the physical side but having someone there all the time must help your mental recovery also. \\nGot my date through for my 6 week review at X  in X it’s the X in  they’ve  arranged for a scan of the my new heart valve at 12pm and then an appointment with the cardiologist at 3.20 pm so looking forward to finding out if everything is working as it should then hopefully I’ll get a date to do my cardiac rehab at one of my local hospitals \\nMy X is going into X on Sunday to have the same op as me on Monday please put her in your thoughts and try to send her some positive energy Hope you all have a great weekend \\nX ❤️\\n \\n</td>\n",

A stent was applied to my LAD, I awoke from a coma! I'm alive. I fought back, went on a strict diet avoided any processed foods for 3 years, lost weight and during that process trained like an animal, bike rides, swims, runs for hours. I then decided to enter an Ironman in Nice, France 4km ocean swim, 185km mountain bike ride and a marathon the worlds toughest 1 day sports event. I finished! My ankle tendinitis kicked at mile 3 my last 23 miles was a killer but I managed 4hrs15mins marathon.\\nI hope to inspire others, what I couldn't believe is that a X year old man completed this Ironman in the gruelling heat. There's always hope if your believe.\\nI still take medicine, but I'm a true believer that food from the earth is the bodies important ingredient. \\nBelow is a list of foods I eat this will help others:\\nveges, chickpeas, fruits, lean meat only and organic if possible from butchers once or twice a week, fish especially sardines, mackerel, salmon. Nuts, raw only almonds, walnuts and cashews. Eggs (never fried), lentils, cocoa, beans, whole rice, olive oil but never salad dressings, cinnamon, turmeric in morning porridge, whole meal pasta ( much never jars of sauce instead chopped tomatoes), greek yogurt only, honey........my stomach hates processed foods I now feel sick when I have pringles for example, avoided any juices from supermarket too high in sugar go eat 2 oranges, only really ate goats cheese but any cheese is ok is little portions), almond/soy/oat/coconut milk only, had drinking yogurts the little ones. Goodbye alcohol no thanks, with celebrations are ok.\\nwill think of more.....\\nBelieve! we can fight together.\\n \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi all.... so back in September I had a CRT-D implant and after seeing my consultant at 8 week check he was happy for me to stay on the ONE tablet... Ramipril... and he advised raw honey to help protect my heart (I now know a friendly bee keeper) so all in all a very lucky lady.\\nHowever as some of you know I stopped drinking alcohol pre my op ... and as part of wanting to live a long and healthy life... I plan to continue being virtually tee total. This has not gone down well with my social group. People apparently assumed post op I would \"get back on it\" and I have even been told I will be boring now! Great support network huh!\\nIt's been mainly down to the lovely people on this site that have helped me view myself as normal and doing well... so thank you all.\\nHowever over Xmas I felt alone and social life had virtually dried up... I had lost my confidence and felt if I did go out it was lots of people drinking and telling me I was boring.\\nThen ...... I thought no.... there is a life out there.. .Just gotta find new friends... that doesn't have to revolve around alcohol. A Great way of meeting people is \"meet up groups\" these are groups anyone can set up and they are everywhere. So wherever you are search for meet up groups in your area and there will probably be some around.\\nHowever when I searched there were none doing what I wanted to do (meals out, theatre and cinema nights) so I created my own on X Dec.. .. there are now 115 members.. .. I organise a meal every month ... have organised comedy clubs and X.... and have met up with some for cinema trips. I have also found a book club locally and busy reading too! \\nI have already met some lovely people... no one knows about my heart... just being fun me.... and I enjoy my lime and sodas over a lovely meal with great conversation. \\nThe Next part of my moving on has been knowing how much I can do exercise wise.. and again many on here have been inspirational.. . And great advise too. So armed with more knowledge I am booked in to see the heart rehab people on Monday to put me through my paces and get me back exercising. I may even buy a fitbit! I wouldn't have known about rehab and what can be accessed without this site ❤\\nSorry for the long post.... just thought there may be others who after heart problems find, like I did, life does change, and we sometimes feel isolated.... but do check out meet up sites easy to join and lots of fun things to do.... and gets us out and about again.

       "0  Hi, I'm X years old and was born with severe aortic stenosis. After 2 operations to balloon the valve I still have moderate to servere stenosis and aortic regurtitation. I am due to have open heart surgery early next year to replace the valve. \\n\\nI was just wondering if anyone could share their experiences with such a predure? As I am a bit nervous about what is to come. \\n\\nThanks in advance!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1  OK everybody \\njust had my appointment with GP..\\nX as per usual. \\nHave asked him to refer me to a specialist regarding MVA and coronary artery spasm. \\nHe's now going to look on X and check them out before deciding who to write a letter to??? Great!!!\\nThen I explained I'm getting constat chest pain and I can't function in my job if this continues. \\nSo I explained when it was happening and dates...all good..\\nThen I try to educate him in Cq10 and can I take a supplement doctor? sorry but I don't know about Cq10 so will have to look it up..FFS!!!  He's answer is that if X and X sell it it must be OK!!! \\nSo I then try to explain that because I'm taking statins I probably need a magnesium test to see if I'm deficent? And if so can I take a magnesium supplement as I'm not sure if I'm getting enough from my diet.\\nso he's answer oh I can send you for a blood test..All good but I've read on here that a normal magnesium test isn't the real picture.\\nSomeone on this forum mentioned it's a specific blood test for magnesium. \\nCAN ANYONE HELP WITH THIS PLEASE?? \\nSo so far it was the usual rushed appointment but I suppose at leat I got ONE THING out of it...a letter to other consultant's in X of my Dr's choice may I add...Seriously you couldn't make it up!!  \\nQuestions: Can anyone give me some idea of good Cq10 supplements X Magnesium once I've had a test for that. \\nAlso can I ask the hospital for a detailed letter regarding my stent procedure in May last year?\\nWill they release such a letter to me the patient?\\nI basically want to know what happened during my procedure because my cardiologist openly said it was very difficult and he was concerned about me?\\nThat's how it's always been left..so in truth I want some answers Especially as my chest pain has got more frequent post stent than before I was even taken into hospital back last April.\\nThank you to everybody that can help me with my questions. ?\\nPs   I also asked him about my latest blood tests...some of which I've posted on here.\\nHe's answer oh all normal with a gruff voice..so all good then? Yeah right considering my LDL is slightly above the 2.0 it should be at...so no doctorits not normal to a heart patient. \\nI asked him about my HbA1c level and LDL particle number and he's response was a blank stare! So No luck there either then..\\nso guys and girls I'm just going to post it on here hoping someone with some knowledge of these things can help??\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "2  Hi I'm new here so bear with me :) though I'm certainly not new to heart palpitations! \\nJust looking for a bit of help and advice really. \\nI've had skipped beats (pvcs) for quite a few years. Only low levels say less than 20 a day but feel every single one and they cause anxiety every time.\\nHave been muddling on ok for a while though through X I started to get more episodes when training in the gym.  Last year I had a couple of occasions where they started up during cardio exercise and didn't stop.\\nHave had probably in excess of 30 ecgs over the years, maybe more. Nothing of note has come up on those.\\n4 Holter monitors which showed wenkebach during sleep and 3 echoes - last one in X - all normal.\\nWell this year?\\nI managed to catch the flu first week of January so I stopped training in the gym. \\nTwo weeks ago tomorrow I decided that i felt well enough to restart and that's where everything has gone wrong.\\n30 mins into cardio training, I started getting pvcs. I started getting panicky so left after a further 10 mins and went straight to a & e. Ecg was all over the place and showed long qt plus some other stuff.\\nThe doctor said I might have long qt and my anxiety shot through the roof and has stayed at the same level since. \\nCutting a long story short, ever since then, I have developed pvcs every time I stand up, walk around, do any kind of activity at all.\\nOver the next week I had 3 trips to a & e with pvcs and all showed sinus tachycardia and nothing else.\\nHad a stress test done privately on Wednesday which showed pvcs in the first few minutes and a couple in the cool down but none at higher heart rates.\\nSaw my electrophysisist / cardiologist who said my stress test was perfectly fine, not bothered about the pvcs and said I had excellent exercise capability but he was going to put me on a low dose betablocker in the short term because my anxiety over the pvcs had got to a point where I was actually struggling to stand up because I was so scared.\\nHe couldn't really answer why they had started so suddenly out of the blue when id never really had a major issue with them before and he said I probably always had them with training but I don't think I did apart from the odd \"pvc storm\" once or twice a year.\\nI'm now on a betablocker and I'm not getting any pvcs anymore when standing/ moving around but I am still getting them during training.\\nI am very scared and anxious when training which I don't think helps.\\nI am just struggling to understand why these have just started so badly whilst training when I have trained for 20 years before without problem. \\nI have to say at this point that training is my life. I'm a X and train 6 days a week and it keeps me sane so this is turning into a living nightmare for me because I'm getting terrified that something dangerous is happening whilst I'm getting the pvcs and training.\\nI thought they might be due to my massive amounts of adrenaline coursing round my system because I've always had pvcs during emotional stress and sex but the cardiologist said they probably weren't caused by excess adrenaline, not to worry and carry on training.\\nI'm just struggling with not having a reason to why this has suddenly happen and in the space of 4 weeks, going from a normal human being to being utterly housebound. I'm scared of doing anything to trigger the pvcs off so I'm not training, not working, not doing anything except laying in bed and I don't know what to do or how to deal with it.\\nI'm already on anti depressants and seeing a counsellor.\\nI just want to understand what is making my heart do what it is so if anyone has been in a similar situation and can offer any words of wisdom or advice, I'd be very grateful as I am missing my training, it's really getting me down and I really want my normal life back.\\nThanks, X xx\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3  I wrote here a few weeks ago about some chest pain I have been suffering with for a while now but I have no diagnosis diagnosis even after 2 exercise ECGs and an echo.  ive since had continuing chest pain and another ECG at my GP but they still cant find anything and have said the ECGs are fine.  I feel like im getting more breathless at time and feel like my chest pain is getting worse.  when this started the chest pain was kind of off to the side, left hand side, I find im getting more pain which is right in the middle and a little bit lower down.  Yesterday I felt sick due to the pain in chest, kind of had a bit of pain on my left shoulder and I was getting funny feelings up my neck, its like a prickly feeling, someone sticking a needle in now and again but I get these in my chest as well.  I also had a funny feeling around the top of my chest at the collar bone area on the left hand side. and a funny feeling under my chin, kind of like a flushing sensation. Ive also found im coughing more but I don't have a cold or chest infection.\\n\\nMy GP is going to refer me to cardio so I can speak to someone this time but in the meantime im concerned about my chest pain and feelings in my neck/shoulder.  Yesterday I was out with some friends and the pain was quite bad and I felt a little sick too but then I felt a bit panicky inside (i dont have anxiety) about it but I noticed if I stood up straight and kind of pushed my chest out I had a tight feeling on the left hand side of my chest- it was like a line drawn across my chest - hard to describe.  when I came home I had 150mg of aspirin and that seemed to help the pain.  I don't want to go to A&E because I don't want to waste their time in case I don't have heart/artery issues but I feel ive got to do something due to the on-going pain.\\n\\nfeel a bit lost to be honest and not sure what to do for the best as I expect my referral to cardio will take weeks if not months...\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "4  Has anyone had to inform their insurance company about a heart attack and stents?

       "5  Day 15 the day from hell !!!!!\\nI wasn’t going to post the following account of day 15 as I thought it’s possibly a step too far but when I started doing these posts  I said it would be truthful warts and all so I’ve decided to tell it like it was and if I offend anyone in the process I apologise in advance. I’ve always been an honest person and to me it’s just another part of my X on the road to full recovery . \\nI told you I’d been a little constipated well things came to a head yesterday it started about about 2pm when I got the urge to go but couldn’t it was there but I couldn’t pass it . I told the nurse who gave me senokot I wanted to do a walk but after 50 metres I got the urge and had to come back sat in the loo for about 45 minutes absolutely nothing would pass . I went up to my room at 4pm to be near the loo just in case as the pain was starting to become a problem . She said it’s been caused by my lifesaver painkillers “Oxycodon” apparently anything with “co” in the title contains codene and this is the major cause of severe constipation. I missed evening supper at 6.30pm as I was scared to leave the room and wasn’t hungry anyway . I had been sat on the loo for another hour but something was stuck there was no way I was going to be able to pass this stool it just felt an impossible task I was told not to push too hard because of my new heart valve just do lots of little pushes. It was now 8.30pm and I’m in real pain I needed a wee but it felt like something was pushing on my prostate and although the urge to have a wee was there I now couldn’t pass water so I’m worried . The nurse said your not gonna like this but I need you to lie on your left hand side on the bed which I did and she proceeded to give me an embarrassing sepository and an enema I had to lay there for at least 10 minutes or longer if I could ignoring the urge to go. After 15 minutes there was still no urge 20 minutes still nothing I lay there for 30 minutes then went to the X ....... what a disaster loads of diarrhoea but “he who would not surface “ was still stuck and refusing to budge I was now very worried and had visions of having to go to the local hospital to be sorted as I was in a lot of pain . The nurse was amazing she kept reassuring me that between us we would sort it . It’s now 11.00pm and I’m given another dose of senokot I told her it’s not going to work I’m just going to do lots more diarrhoea but it won’t sort out the real problem the blockage . I’m now sat there swearing at my my poo .......... come on you little bastard .......why won’t you bleep bleep come. ..... frustration and pain send you over the edge I hope no one heard me because if they had they would  have thought I was a complete fruitcake  !!! \\nThe nurse came back at 11.45pm and suggested she put some gloves on and massaged my rectum from behind whilst I sat on the X ......... I can honestly say I’ve never felt so vulnerable, embarressed  and completely exposed as I did when she was doing that. It was painful and she kept apologising but I told her to carry on as this needed sorting I’d got to the stage where I didn’t care any longer this had to come out . 30 minutes of massage of the rectum and she wanted me to start pushing oh my god I was pushing she was massaging and it eventually happened I can’t describe how it felt it was a mixture of joy, an element of embarrassment and complete relief and within minutes of it happening the pressure was off my prostate and I was able to wee which was a godsend. It’s now around 12.45 to 1am and it’s all about getting cleaned up and trying to get some sleep I thought I’d endured enough embarrassment for one day then she came back in the room and said because of all the laxatives we’ve given you plus the enema and the sepository I’m gonna need you to wear this just for tonight in case you have an accident while your asleeep ........... “an adult pull-up “ I said what do you expect me to do with that she said wear it under your boxers or your pyjamas just for tonight after everything she’d done for me it was the least I could do so I got changed and went to bed \\nI Woke up this morning and after a coffee managed to go  to the loo without pain that will be last nights senakot still working through \\nThe events between 2pm and 1 am yesterday were so bizarre you mind is saying ...... did that really happen ......... well unfortunately it did. I now have the dilemma of knowing what the root cause is “ Oxycoden” and trying to cut back on using my pain killers it’s a viscous circle and one that’s gonna take some real managing as I never want to find myself in a similar situation to yesterday \\nI’m shattered and need to catch up on some sleep and as previously stated I hope I haven’t offended anyone by just being honest \\n\\nX ❤️\\n  \n",
       "6  After seventeen days in hospital, fifteen post op I finally made it home on Saturday.\\nWell, that was an experience, I am thinking of designing a new board game titled Grandma’s Heart Surgery.\\nI was in theatre for nearly nine hours as my surgeon tried three times to repair my mitral valve, each time restarting my heart to test the repair.  It was to no avail and so a mechanical valve was inserted as agreed pre-op. Seemingly my valve had some rheumatic damage (confirming that I had rheumatic fever as a child), also one of the mitral flaps had a very wavy edge instead of being a smooth curve; a congenital defect. The four other procedures were carried out.\\nForty-eight hours in X were not very pleasant, nausea, sickness, extremely sensitive sense of taste and smell and wierd dreams.  Fortunately it went by quite quickly and I was very sluggish.  I found the strong pain killing drugs were the worse for making me ill so forty-eight hours post op decided to only take paracetamol.  I did have some pain particularly as the paracetamol wore off but managed to control it with some breathing techniques etc.  I will write about this in ‘my tips’ further on. I think you always need to feel some pain so that you can tell if you are doing something that is damaging the healing.\\nThree days in X began with my body reacting differently than most to the anaesthetic and morphine, let’s just say I didn’t need laxatives!  At the same time I had put on twelve kilos with fluid retention. I could hardly breath or move and so the poor nursing angels had to do everything for me.  Once the intravenous diuretic got working  the fluid started to come off and I became mobile. Lost two or three kilos a day, I have never lost weight so quickly. I wouldn’t recommend that particular diet regime though. My pacing wires were left in for as long as possible to allow my heart to remain in sinus rhythm and were removed day five post op and a day after the chest drains. I didn’t find having any of them out particularly unpleasant, the little sensation I did feel was short lived and being free of them was bliss.\\nStill suffering with the trots, I was moved to a room on the X.  Another step in the right direction.  Shortly after returning to the X my heart went into Afib, back to theatre for a cardioversion, unfortunately it didn’t work so going to be reviewed in three months.  Chest X-ray showing fluid around lungs so kept on strong diuretics.  Next came an increase in my white blood cell count, normal is ten mine had risen to fifteeen, every possible bodily fluid was tested for infection, all negative. They didn’t take any chances so had me back on intravenous antibiotics. Having had mitral valve surgery there is a slight risk of Endocarditis, an infection that attacks the wall of the heart. Slowly my white blood cell count came down and was switched to oral antibiotics, first box✔️. Second chest X-ray showed that the fluid around my lungs had reduced but still not good enough to go home.  Came off intravenous anticoagulant and started Warfarin, my INR reading needed to be stable at between three and four before I could go home. Chest X-ray on Friday showed quite an improvement, still a small amount of fluid but happy for me to go home on strong diuretics, another box✔️.  Blood test showed good INR reading, last box✔️. Yippee, I could go home.\\nThis is not a scare story but one that reveals how resilient the human body and spirit are.  It is a tribute to the skill and dedication of the surgeon and his team; and the compassionate care of the nursing angels.\\nEach one of us  is different, everybody reacts differently, we all have complex heart issues unique to us but we all get through it with the skills of the professionals and by supporting one another.\\nMy tips are: \\nPractice these thoughts -  ‘this too will pass’; ‘just for today’; or even ‘just for this hour’; ‘today is the tomorrow I worried about yesterday’.\\nNot sure the menfolk will like this, take in copious amounts of 100% pure lavender oil and splash it on your huggy. It will aid breathing and help you to relax. I also used breathing exercises and meditated whilst listening to soft, relaxing music.\\nWeeks before surgery massage the incision site with bio oil twice daily to prepare your skin. My scar is looking pretty good already, half the stitches have dissolved.A big thank you to all my heart chums for keeping me in your thoughts, it was good to know you were rooting for me.\\nNow then, let’s get cracking designing my new board game, you never know it could be a best seller next X, especially if the winner gets a copy of my heart surgery video - yes my surgeon is preparing one for me as promised.\\nThe photo was taken as I left hospital, not bad?\\nLots of X,\\nX xxx❤️?❣️\\n                         \n",
       "7  Arrived at hospital for my repeat scan on my left leg at 8.30am for my 9am appointment saw a different radiologist quite a chatty young man who’d been doing the job for X years and told me he scans everything from pregnant women to testicles looking for everything from baby abnormalities to blood clots to cancer. He told me the clot hadn’t moved any further up my thigh which was really good news . He showed me the blood clots on the screen which I found fascinating. It appears the antibiotics and daily injections are keeping them stable for now. My next appointment was at 10am at the phlebotomy department I was early and arrived at 9.30am and they said they might be able to get me in early. Everyone who was arriving was having blood tests done so I assumed that’s why I was here but the head nurse practitioner called me in and said I’m not taking bloods today I want to go through the negatives of you taking Tinzaparin on a daily basis for 6 weeks. She said your susceptible to excessive bleeding if you get a cut and it doesn’t clot in 30 minutes go to A&E if you notice any bruising and don’t remember banging yourself go to A&E if you get any headaches that appear to be coming up from your neck go to A&E if you bang your head go straight to A&E and they’ll check you for bleeding on the brain . .......... I said “ I’m so glad I’m come to see you today your a little ray of sunshine and full of positivity “ fortunately she got the irony. It’s good they take the time to warn you so it was appreciated. Next stop up to the X for all my info including my scan to be reviewed. I was sat in waiting room for about 10 minutes then taken onto a ward had to take my trousers off so they could examine my legs they said they were happy as the redness that was apparent a week ago had disappeared and the swelling had gone down . The asked me loads of questions about my heart and the op and then told me tha5 they were happy with the treatment plan and 5hey would do another Doppler scan after 5 weeks when the injections had finished. I would also receive an appointment to see the heamotologist. So I keep going and hopefully it’s all sorted in another 5 weeks. \\nAs you all know by now nothing is ever straight forward with me and I’ve had a bad cough for about three weeks and the constant coughing has resulted in me pulling the muscles in between my ribs on my left hand side this is really painful and affects movement and sleeping on Thursday I was on a local bus which was full of people and I started to have a coughing fit for some reason everything went quiet and it hurt that much I shouted out “ fucking bastard “  ( sorry) and everyone looked at me like I’d got “terets” I couldn’t wait to get off the bus . The doctor has given me a prescription for some antibiotics but I can’t use the prescription for another week because I’m already on antibiotics for my leg and he wants me to see if it will clear up on it’s own but I don’t see it shifting. \\nOn the good news side the doctor has just told me he’s happy for me to start driving whoooooooo !!!!! I can’t believe it I thought I’d have to wait 6 weeks but the DVLA say 4 weeks it’s given me back my freedom. X drove to the post office to take a letter that needed to go by recorded delivery I was sat in the car with a stupid grin on my face like I’d just won the lottery. Happy days. \\nThis X has made me realise how much easier it must be if your in a relationship and living with someone who is there 24/7 to support and do the things you can’t. Unfortunately I’ve just finalised my divorce as you know and not currently in a relationship and you do end up doing things you’ve been told not too which can affect your recovery. It’s not just the physical side but having someone there all the time must help your mental recovery also. \\nGot my date through for my 6 week review at X  in X it’s the X in  they’ve  arranged for a scan of the my new heart valve at 12pm and then an appointment with the cardiologist at 3.20 pm so looking forward to finding out if everything is working as it should then hopefully I’ll get a date to do my cardiac rehab at one of my local hospitals \\nMy X is going into X on Sunday to have the same op as me on Monday please put her in your thoughts and try to send her some positive energy Hope you all have a great weekend \\nX ❤️\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "8  3 years ago, I had a massive out of hospital cardiac arrest, I was saved by 2 off duty Doctors who applied CPR and defibrillator worked 2nd time! A stent was applied to my LAD, I awoke from a coma! I'm alive. I fought back, went on a strict diet avoided any processed foods for 3 years, lost weight and during that process trained like an animal, bike rides, swims, runs for hours. I then decided to enter an Ironman in Nice, France 4km ocean swim, 185km mountain bike ride and a marathon the worlds toughest 1 day sports event. I finished! My ankle tendinitis kicked at mile 3 my last 23 miles was a killer but I managed 4hrs15mins marathon.\\nI hope to inspire others, what I couldn't believe is that a X year old man completed this Ironman in the gruelling heat. There's always hope if your believe.\\nI still take medicine, but I'm a true believer that food from the earth is the bodies important ingredient. \\nBelow is a list of foods I eat this will help others:\\nveges, chickpeas, fruits, lean meat only and organic if possible from butchers once or twice a week, fish especially sardines, mackerel, salmon. Nuts, raw only almonds, walnuts and cashews. Eggs (never fried), lentils, cocoa, beans, whole rice, olive oil but never salad dressings, cinnamon, turmeric in morning porridge, whole meal pasta ( much never jars of sauce instead chopped tomatoes), greek yogurt only, honey........my stomach hates processed foods I now feel sick when I have pringles for example, avoided any juices from supermarket too high in sugar go eat 2 oranges, only really ate goats cheese but any cheese is ok is little portions), almond/soy/oat/coconut milk only, had drinking yogurts the little ones. Goodbye alcohol no thanks, with celebrations are ok.\\nwill think of more.....\\nBelieve! we can fight together.\\n \\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "9  Hi all.... so back in September I had a CRT-D implant and after seeing my consultant at 8 week check he was happy for me to stay on the ONE tablet... Ramipril... and he advised raw honey to help protect my heart (I now know a friendly bee keeper) so all in all a very lucky lady.\\nHowever as some of you know I stopped drinking alcohol pre my op ... and as part of wanting to live a long and healthy life... I plan to continue being virtually tee total. This has not gone down well with my social group. People apparently assumed post op I would \"get back on it\" and I have even been told I will be boring now! Great support network huh!\\nIt's been mainly down to the lovely people on this site that have helped me view myself as normal and doing well... so thank you all.\\nHowever over Xmas I felt alone and social life had virtually dried up... I had lost my confidence and felt if I did go out it was lots of people drinking and telling me I was boring.\\nThen ...... I thought no.... there is a life out there.. .Just gotta find new friends... that doesn't have to revolve around alcohol. A Great way of meeting people is \"meet up groups\" these are groups anyone can set up and they are everywhere. So wherever you are search for meet up groups in your area and there will probably be some around.\\nHowever when I searched there were none doing what I wanted to do (meals out, theatre and cinema nights) so I created my own on X Dec.. .. there are now 115 members.. .. I organise a meal every month ... have organised comedy clubs and X.... and have met up with some for cinema trips. I have also found a book club locally and busy reading too! \\nI have already met some lovely people... no one knows about my heart... just being fun me.... and I enjoy my lime and sodas over a lovely meal with great conversation. \\nThe Next part of my moving on has been knowing how much I can do exercise wise.. and again many on here have been inspirational.. . And great advise too. So armed with more knowledge I am booked in to see the heart rehab people on Monday to put me through my paces and get me back exercising. I may even buy a fitbit! I wouldn't have known about rehab and what can be accessed without this site ❤\\nSorry for the long post.... just thought there may be others who after heart problems find, like I did, life does change, and we sometimes feel isolated.... but do check out meet up sites easy to join and lots of fun things to do.... and gets us out and about again. X\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 "
